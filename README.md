Chat with DOCX Files Using AI is a Streamlit app enabling users to engage in AI-driven conversations based on content extracted from uploaded DOCX files. Users upload files, pose questions, and receive responses generated by AI models. The app employs Langchain for natural language processing tasks, Google Generative AI for response generation, and FAISS for similarity search. Conversations are conducted via a simple text input interface. Key features include automatic text extraction from DOCX files, AI-powered responses tailored to user queries, and conversation history retention. To use the app, users upload DOCX files, ask questions, and interact with the AI. The app's setup requires installing dependencies, setting up a Google API key, and running the application with Streamlit. Contributions to the project are encouraged, and support is available via email.
